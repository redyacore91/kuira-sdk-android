# Kuira SDK — Integration Guide

**Alpha — `{{ kuira_version }}`**

Build a Midnight zero-knowledge dApp on Android by adding **one dependency**, declaring your **own passkey domain**, and hosting **one tiny JSON file** on it. That's the whole on-ramp.

This guide walks the recipe end-to-end. Two **public** reference apps consume
the SDK exactly as described below — clone either and read along:

- **[Kuira Starter](https://github.com/kuiralabs/kuira-starter-android)** — the
  minimal counter dApp. Sigil identity + wallet + a one-circuit Compact contract.
  Clone it, set your `applicationId` + `rpId`, run. (Also a GitHub template.)
- **[BBoard](https://github.com/kuiralabs/example-bboard-android)** — a shared
  on-chain bulletin board (post / take-down) showing the deploy → call → read flow.

The snippets below are extracted from those apps; when in doubt, the linked
source is the ground truth.

---

## What the SDK gives you

Adding the one line below brings:

- **Sigil identity** — a passkey-derived DID (`did:key` + Ed25519). One biometric, no recovery phrase, no maintainer dependency. Backed up to Google Block Store, encrypted with a key you can't read.
- **Wallet** — Midnight HD wallet (unshielded + shielded NIGHT, Dust gas), with live balance, send, receive, and a drop-in Compose **wallet panel** if you want it.
- **Contract surface** — deploy / call / read state on any `.compact` contract; ZK proof generation runs on-device (no proof-server hop required).
- **Indexer + chain client** — block / state / event subscription, backed by Midnight's official indexer.
- **App-state cloud backup** — your dApp's per-user data rides the sigil's Block Store backup automatically. The backup blob is PRF-encrypted client-side before Google's Block Store touches it.

Drop in the prebuilt UI, build your own on the same contracts, or go fully headless — see *Choose your level* below.

## 1. Prerequisites

| | |
|---|---|
| Android Gradle Plugin | **≥ 8.13** (matches the SDK build) |
| Kotlin | **≥ 2.3** |
| `compileSdk` | 35+ |
| `minSdk` | **30** — required (the SDK uses keystore APIs added in API 30: biometric ⊕ device-credential) |
| Hilt + KSP | Required — the SDK is Hilt-first; your app applies both |
| A web domain you control | Required for the passkey relying party (GitHub Pages is fine for dev) |
| Your app's signing-cert SHA-256 | Needed for `assetlinks.json` (step 4) |

Full toolchain (JDK 17, Android Studio, Docker, Node 20+, the `mn` CLI, compactc)
— see **[Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)**.

---

## 2. Add the dependency — *one line*

### Choose your level

Kuira meets you at the level you want — and the dependency you pick reflects it:

- **Drop in the prebuilt UI** — `io.github.kuiralabs:dapp-ui`. Ready-made,
  themeable Compose components — the **wallet pill**, the **sigil pill**, and the
  **Settings panel** (network, recovery phrase, lock, sign-out), all in one
  `PanelBar` — wired to SDK state out of the box with safe security defaults
  (`FLAG_SECURE`, biometric gates, an auto-clearing clipboard). Restyle with a
  colors object; you write no wallet logic. The fastest path — see
  [Set up Sigil identity](recipes/set-up-sigil-identity.md).
- **Build your own experience** — also `dapp-ui` (its ViewModels) or
  `midnight-sdk`. Render your own screens on the same public contracts the pills
  are built on — `WalletRecovery`, `WalletPanelViewModel`,
  `SigilPanelViewModel` / `SigilSession`, `MidnightContract`, `MidnightSdk`. The
  SDK keeps the hard parts (crypto, secure vault, on-device proving, sync,
  session-lock); the screens are yours. Every bundled component is just the first
  consumer of a contract you can call directly — e.g.
  [Reveal & restore the recovery phrase](recipes/reveal-and-restore-the-recovery-phrase.md).
- **Go headless** — `io.github.kuiralabs:midnight-sdk`. The full wallet, identity,
  and contract surface with **no Compose** pulled in; you build the UI layer
  top-to-bottom. See [§ 7 Going headless](#7-going-headless-no-panel).

!!! note "Theming today, more tuning coming"
    The prebuilt components expose theming now plus a small set of behavioral
    knobs; richer per-component tuning hooks are on the roadmap. Until a knob
    exists, the build-your-own path gives full control of that surface — the
    contracts carry no UI policy.

Maven Central is already in every Android project's defaults, so there's no repo
config to add. In `app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.android")
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose")          // only if your own UI is Compose
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp")
    id("com.google.dagger.hilt.android")
}

android {
    namespace = "com.example.mydapp"
    compileSdk = 36
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId = "com.example.mydapp"
        minSdk = 30
        targetSdk = 36
    }
}

dependencies {
    // ── Pick ONE Kuira entry (see "Choose your level" above) ──
    //
    // Prebuilt pills + the ViewModels behind them (Compose). Drop the wallet
    // and sigil panels in as-is, OR build your own UI on the same contracts.
    implementation("io.github.kuiralabs:dapp-ui:{{ kuira_version }}")
    //
    // OR — headless core, no Compose pulled in. For dApps building the whole
    // UI layer top-to-bottom.
    // implementation("io.github.kuiralabs:midnight-sdk:{{ kuira_version }}")

    // Hilt processor — required, the SDK is Hilt-first
    ksp("com.google.dagger:hilt-compiler:2.58")

    // your own app code, your own Compose deps, etc.
}
```

That single Kuira line brings the whole consumer surface — passkey, sigil,
wallet, ZK proving, contract deploy/call, indexer, panel UI (if you picked
`dapp-ui`) — onto your compile classpath transitively. No per-module
redeclaration.

---

## 3. Declare YOUR passkey domain

The SDK provides **no default `PasskeyConfig`** — that's deliberate. A passkey
is bound to a domain, and that domain must be **yours**. If the SDK baked in a
default, every consumer would silently route through the maintainer's domain
and PRF would only work after the maintainer added them to a maintainer-hosted
`assetlinks.json` — i.e. the "open" SDK would actually be permissioned.

Add a tiny Hilt module (anywhere in your `di/`):

```kotlin
package com.example.mydapp.di

import com.midnight.kuira.core.identity.passkey.PasskeyConfig
import dagger.Module
import dagger.Provides
import dagger.hilt.InstallIn
import dagger.hilt.components.SingletonComponent
import javax.inject.Singleton

@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
object IdentityConfigModule {

    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun providePasskeyConfig() = PasskeyConfig(
        rpId   = "mydapp.example.com",   // YOUR domain (matches assetlinks.json below)
        rpName = "My dApp",              // shown in the biometric prompt
    )
}
```

> If you forget this, you'll get a clear Dagger missing-binding error at build
> time. That's intentional — it forces you to declare your domain before
> shipping.

---

## 4. Host `assetlinks.json` on YOUR domain

Android's `CredentialManager` checks Digital Asset Links to verify *your* app
may use passkeys for *your* domain. Place this file at:

```
https://<your-domain>/.well-known/assetlinks.json
```

```json
[{
  "relation": [
    "delegate_permission/common.get_login_creds",
    "delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"
  ],
  "target": {
    "namespace": "android_app",
    "package_name": "com.example.mydapp",
    "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["AB:CD:EF:01:23:45:67:89:..."]
  }
}]
```

**Get your cert SHA-256**:
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore <your-keystore> -alias <your-alias> | grep SHA256
```
For debug builds, the default keystore is `~/.android/debug.keystore` (alias
`androiddebugkey`, password `android`).

> Without this file (or with a wrong package name / SHA-256), the biometric
> prompt fails and PRF can't derive your sigil. This is a one-time host;
> updates are needed only when you change signing certs.

---

## 5. Develop against a localnet

You don't need testnet tokens or a deployed contract to build. The **`UNDEPLOYED`**
network is a full Midnight stack — node + indexer + proof server — running
locally in Docker: instant, free, and ephemeral (reset it any time). It's the
recommended loop for day-to-day development; switch to PREPROD only when you want
the hosted chain.

!!! warning "PreProd's first sync replays from genesis — set up cloud backup first"
    Localnet is instant. **PreProd is a long-lived chain with a large history**, so
    a wallet's *first* sync there replays from genesis — minutes, not seconds. To
    make it a fast delta instead, set up
    [cloud backup](recipes/back-up-wallet-across-devices.md) **before** you switch
    to PreProd. It needs a one-time Google OAuth client (your app's package +
    signing SHA-1); without it, cloud sync silently fails
    (`UNREGISTERED_ON_API_CONSOLE`) and PreProd keeps replaying from genesis on
    every fresh sync — the wallet works, it's just slow.

### 5a. Start the localnet — the Midnight Wallet CLI (recommended)

The recommended way to run and fund a localnet is the **Midnight Wallet CLI**
(`mn`), installed from npm as `midnight-wallet-cli`. It wraps the Docker stack
and wallet funding behind a few commands:

```bash
# one-time — needs Docker running + Node 20+
npm install -g midnight-wallet-cli          # installs `midnight` (alias `mn`)

mn localnet up                              # start node + indexer + proof server (Docker)
mn localnet status                          # check it's healthy
# … develop …
mn localnet down                            # tear it down
```

!!! note "Tested localnet stack — pin the node to `0.22.5`"
    Tested localnet stack: `midnight-node:0.22.5` (on-chain Compact runtime
    0.16.0). Older nodes (≤0.22.3) ship runtime 0.15.0 and reject a contract
    compiled for 0.16.0. `mn` pulls the node image; if you run Docker by hand,
    pin the node tag to `0.22.5`.

!!! warning "Windows — `mn localnet up` can time out"
    On Windows, `mn localnet up` can fail with `spawnSync … cmd.exe ETIMEDOUT`.
    Bring the stack up directly:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f ~/.midnight/localnet/compose.yml up -d
    ```

Fund the wallet your app shows (copy its address from the wallet panel's receive
screen):

```bash
mn airdrop 10000 --wallet mn_addr_undeployed1… --network undeployed   # NIGHT for fees
```

Dust (gas) for the app's embedded wallet is enabled **in-app** — tap **Register
dust** in the wallet panel.

!!! note "`mn dust register` targets a *named* CLI wallet, not the app's wallet"
    `mn dust register --wallet <name>` needs a *named* wallet from
    `mn wallet generate`; it cannot target the app's embedded wallet address.

> Localnet is ephemeral — `mn localnet down` (or a Docker restart) wipes all
> state, including funded balances. Re-airdrop after each fresh `up`.

### 5b. Let the app reach the localnet

The SDK already maps `UNDEPLOYED` to the right host per device type
(`NetworkConfig`):

- **Emulator** — `10.0.2.2` (the emulator's alias for your machine's
  `localhost`). Nothing to do.

  !!! note "Emulator ABI — x86_64 works on `0.1.0-alpha04`+"
      x86_64 (Intel) and arm64 emulators both work on `0.1.0-alpha04`+ (the
      native lib ships `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64`). On alpha03 and earlier the lib
      is arm64-only — an x86_64 AVD fails at launch with
      `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError`; use alpha04+ or an arm64 AVD.
- **Physical device** — `127.0.0.1`, so the three localnet ports must be
  tunnelled over the debug bridge. The SDK ships a Gradle plugin that does this
  automatically on every `installDebug` — apply it once, no configuration:

  ```kotlin
  // app/build.gradle.kts
  plugins {
      id("io.github.kuiralabs.localnet") version "<sdk-version>"
  }
  ```

  It registers an `adbReverseLocalnet` task wired ahead of `installDebug`, so
  deploying to a connected physical device forwards ports 9944 (node RPC),
  8088 (indexer), and 6300 (proof server) for you. Emulators use `10.0.2.2`
  and are skipped automatically.

  The example apps apply it exactly this way — see them for a working reference:
  [BBoard](https://github.com/kuiralabs/example-bboard-android/blob/main/app/build.gradle.kts)
  and the [starter](https://github.com/kuiralabs/kuira-starter-android/blob/main/app/build.gradle.kts).

  **Required for physical devices** — the app can't reach the localnet without
  these three port forwards (the plugin runs them for you on `installDebug`; run
  them by hand if you're not using the plugin):

  ```bash
  adb reverse tcp:9944 tcp:9944   # node RPC
  adb reverse tcp:8088 tcp:8088   # indexer
  adb reverse tcp:6300 tcp:6300   # proof server
  ```

  **No "Install via USB" on the phone?** Some devices hide it. Build and push
  the APK over `adb` instead:

  ```bash
  ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
  adb push app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk /data/local/tmp/app.apk
  adb shell pm install -r /data/local/tmp/app.apk
  ```

### 5c. Allow cleartext to the localnet (debug only)

Production hits HTTPS. Localnet is plain HTTP, so declare cleartext **in a
debug-only manifest** — release builds stay HTTPS-clean:

```xml
<!-- app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml -->
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" />
</manifest>
```

> Why debug-only: the SDK's release variants are HTTPS-clean and don't grant
> any cleartext allowance, so each app declares its own in a debug-only manifest
> — release stays cleartext-free.

---

## 6. Minimal "Hello World" — deploy + call

Your `Application` is `@HiltAndroidApp`, and your activity is a Hilt'd
**`FragmentActivity`** — `AppCompatActivity` is the usual choice, since the
panel hosts a biometric prompt that needs a FragmentActivity host:

```kotlin
@HiltAndroidApp
class MyApp : Application()

@AndroidEntryPoint
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
                MyDappScreen()  // your UI underneath

                // Drop-in combined sigil + wallet UI: a pair of draggable
                // floating chips that own their own state. The wallet pill
                // builds the SDK (one biometric) the first time it shows, and
                // owns network selection — its pick drives the SDK's durable
                // NetworkPreferenceStore, which your screen can follow.
                PanelBar(
                    floating = true,
                    network = selectedNetwork,
                    onNetworkChange = ::selectNetwork,
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is the canonical integration every reference app uses — see
[Set up Sigil identity](recipes/set-up-sigil-identity.md). (The lower-level
`SigilStatusPanel` / `WalletStatusPanel` are still available if you want to
place each panel inline yourself.)

Your dApp logic gets the SDK from the injected `MidnightSdkProvider` — observe
`sdkProvider.sdk` (a `StateFlow<MidnightSdk?>`, non-null once the wallet panel
has bootstrapped) or suspend on `awaitSdk()`:

```kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class MyDappViewModel @Inject constructor(
    @ApplicationContext private val context: Context,
    private val sdkProvider: MidnightSdkProvider,
) : ViewModel() {

    fun deployAndCall() = viewModelScope.launch {
        val sdk = sdkProvider.awaitSdk()   // waits for the panel to bootstrap it

        // 1. Install your contract's proving keys — required before the first
        //    deploy/call (see §6.1), or proving fails.
        ProvingKeyManager(context).installCircuitKeysFromAssets()

        // 2. Build a write-capable handle. create() takes the SDK's config;
        //    contractJs is an InputStream from assets; deploy/call need the
        //    coin public key + each circuit's verifier-key bytes.
        val verifier = context.assets
            .open("keys/myCircuit.verifier").use { it.readBytes() }
        val contract = MidnightContract.create(sdk.config) {
            name = "mycontract"
            contractJs = context.assets.open("runtime/mycontract-contract.js")
            coinPublicKey = sdk.coinPublicKey
            circuitVerifierKeys = mapOf("myCircuit" to verifier)
        }

        // 3. Deploy, then call a circuit. `call(name, …args)` is stringly-typed;
        //    the contract Gradle plugin also generates a typed `MyContract`
        //    facade so `MyContract(contract).myCircuit()` is checked at compile
        //    time (see the deploy-and-call recipe).
        val address = contract.deploy().contractAddress
        contract.call("myCircuit")

        // 4. Read typed ledger state (lossless — no cell-hex parsing).
        val readOnly = MidnightContract.create(sdk.config) {
            contractJs = context.assets.open("runtime/mycontract-contract.js")
            this.address = address
        }
        val count = MyContract(readOnly).ledger().count   // typed facade; or untyped: readOnly.ledger().getUint64("count")
    }
}
```

### 6.1 Install your contract's proving keys (required)

ZK proofs run **on the device**, so every circuit your contract calls needs its
proving keys + a BLS parameter set present **before the first deploy/call** —
otherwise the call fails at the proving step. Ship them in `assets/` — sync them
in with the `io.github.kuiralabs.contract` Gradle plugin
(`{{ kuira_contract_plugin_version }}`), the recommended path, which stages the
contract runtime and circuit keys into `assets/` for you. Without the plugin, use
the hand-rolled `Copy` task shown in the
[deploy-and-call recipe](recipes/deploy-and-call-a-compact-contract.md). Then
install once at runtime — it's idempotent, so call it before each action:

```kotlin
import com.midnight.kuira.core.compact.proving.ProvingKeyManager

// Discovers the circuit keys bundled in assets and stages them
// where the on-device prover looks.
ProvingKeyManager(context).installCircuitKeysFromAssets()
```

!!! note "Imports — use the `core.compact.proving` package"
    `ProvingKeyManager` and `ProvingMode` both live in
    `com.midnight.kuira.core.compact.proving`. There is a same-named
    `ProvingMode` *typealias* in `com.midnight.kuira.core.crypto.proving` — do
    **not** import that one; always reference
    `com.midnight.kuira.core.compact.proving.ProvingMode`.

The shared **wallet** proving keys ship the full BLS parameter set
(`bls_midnight_2p5`–`2p15`), so a small contract circuit (e.g. a counter that
needs `2p5`) finds the size it requires from the wallet keys — you do **not**
bundle BLS per contract. Just make sure the wallet keys are provisioned: they
are, during SDK bootstrap, and you can ship them in the APK to skip the first-run
download with `kuiraContract { bundleWalletKeys = true }` (see
[On-device proving](on-device-proving.md)). The
**[Kuira Starter](https://github.com/kuiralabs/kuira-starter-android)**'s
`CounterContract` shows the full pattern end-to-end.

> For a larger, multi-step contract (commit / reveal, witness packing,
> indexer-state polling, retry, force-resync), the **[BBoard](https://github.com/kuiralabs/example-bboard-android)**
> reference app shows the deploy → call → read flow end-to-end.

---

## 7. Going headless (no panel)

If you don't want the Compose wallet panel, swap the dep:

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.kuiralabs:midnight-sdk:{{ kuira_version }}")  // no dapp-ui
```

You still own bootstrap + sigil forging — `MidnightSdkProvider.ensureSdk(...)`
throws `SigilRequiredException` until a sigil exists. Forge it through
`PasskeyManager` directly, or use the `SigilSession` helper.

`midnight-sdk` does not pull Compose — the headless entry stays small.

---

## 8. Shipping a release build

The starter ships `isMinifyEnabled = false` so newcomers see exactly what compiles. For a **production release**, turn on R8 and publish an **App Bundle** — both matter a lot, because the SDK carries a native on-device ZK-proving core.

```kotlin title="app/build.gradle.kts"
android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
            isMinifyEnabled = true
            // The SDK ships its own consumer ProGuard rules — AGP applies them automatically.
            proguardFiles(getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"))
        }
    }
}
```

```bash
./gradlew :app:bundleRelease   # an .aab for Play — not a universal .apk
```

### What it costs in size

Measured on the counter starter (one small circuit):

| Build | Size | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Universal APK, minify **off** | ~152 MB | both ABIs + an unstripped dex — worst case, never shipped |
| Universal APK, R8 **on** | ~93 MB | R8 strips the dex from ~65 MB → ~6 MB (most was SDK code your app never calls) |
| **Per-device** (App Bundle + R8) | **~60 MB** | Play delivers one ABI per device, not both |

A real release lands around **~60 MB per device** — comfortably inside [Google Play's 200 MB app-bundle limit](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859372). The floor is the **native proving library** (~20–24 MB of Rust — the BLS/halo2 prover + QuickJS): R8 can't shrink it, because it's the cost of proving **on the device** rather than on a server. Bundling the wallet proving keys (`bundleWalletKeys = true`) adds ~33 MB on top; the default runtime download keeps them out of the binary.

!!! tip "Two settings do almost all the work"
    `isMinifyEnabled = true` (kills the dex bloat) + `bundleRelease` (one ABI per device). Everything after that is single-digit MB.

## Common pitfalls

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Dagger: *"PasskeyConfig cannot be provided without an @Provides-annotated method"* | Step 3 — declare your own `PasskeyConfig` module. |
| Runtime: *"CLEARTEXT communication to 10.0.2.2 not permitted by network security policy"* | Step 5 — add the debug manifest. |
| Biometric prompt fails / PRF returns null | Step 4 — `assetlinks.json` missing, wrong `package_name`, or wrong cert SHA-256. |
| Contract call fails at the proving step / *"circuit keys not found"* / *"BLS params"* | §6.1 — install your contract's proving keys before the first deploy/call (and bundle the right BLS set for small circuits). |
| App balance stays at 0 after an airdrop | The wallet's background subscription is live; check `adb logcat` for indexer connectivity. On localnet, state is ephemeral — restarting the localnet wipes funds. |
| Balance stays 0 / *"Loading…"* on a **physical device** | Run the three `adb reverse` commands (9944 node, 8088 indexer, 6300 proof server) or apply the `io.github.kuiralabs.localnet` plugin (§5b). |
| `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError` at launch on an x86_64 emulator | The native lib is arm64-only before `0.1.0-alpha04`. Upgrade to alpha04+ (ships `x86_64`) or use an arm64 AVD. |
| `Custom error: 168` or a dust-fee / time-to-dismiss failure on dust registration or the first tx | Fixed in SDK `0.1.0-alpha04` — upgrade. An unexpected `Custom error: N` not in the known set usually means a client↔node ledger-version mismatch — confirm your node is `0.22.5`. |
| `Could not resolve io.github.kuiralabs:…` | Ensure `mavenCentral()` is in your repositories **and** the version is actually published — check [central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.kuiralabs/dapp-ui](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.kuiralabs/dapp-ui). |

## Known limitations (alpha)

The alpha ships with one known dependency you should be aware of. It isn't a
blocker for building, but it shapes what "alpha" means in practice and will
evolve as Midnight matures.

### Proving infrastructure downloads from a Midnight *dev* URL

On first launch the SDK fetches Midnight's **protocol-level** proving assets
— the universal BLS parameters and the wallet's shielded-spend / Dust circuit
keys — from
`https://midnight-s3-fileshare-dev-eu-west-1.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`.
This is the same bucket Midnight's own tooling uses; it's **Midnight's
bucket, not the SDK maintainer's**, and the URL is labeled `-dev-`. There is
no production SLA on it.

**What this means in practice:**

- If Midnight retires, renames, or restricts that bucket, every alpha dApp
  briefly can't generate proofs until the SDK is updated.
- The right party to publish a production URL is Midnight (the asset owner),
  not the SDK maintainer. So the alpha *documents* this dependency rather
  than self-hosting.

**Your own `.compact` contract's proving keys are NOT affected by this.** Those
download from a URL **you** supply when you call
`ProvingKeyManager.downloadCircuitKeys(baseUrl = …, …)` — e.g. BBoard hosts
BBoard's keys. You always own your contract's keys. This
limitation is only about the *protocol-wide* keys that every Midnight dApp
shares.

**How it will evolve.** When Midnight publishes a production URL — or, if
that's not in their immediate roadmap, when the SDK mirrors these files under
a `kuiralabs`-controlled URL with a version pin (`ProvingKeyManager.CURRENT_VERSION`
tracks the protocol version, currently 9) — the SDK swaps the constant and
re-publishes. The expected migration cost for a consumer is a single SDK
version bump; no app-side code change.
