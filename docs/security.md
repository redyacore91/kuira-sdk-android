# Security Policy

Kuira is a wallet and identity SDK for the Midnight blockchain on Android.
Because it touches seed material, signing keys, and on-chain authority, we
take security reports seriously. This document covers how to report
vulnerabilities, what's in scope, and — honestly — what isn't yet.

---

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please report security issues privately.** Public GitHub issues are the
wrong venue for unpatched vulnerabilities.

### How to reach us

- **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred):
  <https://github.com/kuiralabs/kuira-sdk-android/security/advisories/new>
  — Private channel that lets you and the maintainer collaborate on a fix
  before disclosure. Encrypted on GitHub's side.
- **Email:** `kuiralabs@gmail.com`
  — For PGP-encrypted reports, the maintainer's signing key (used for
  Maven Central artifacts) doubles as the security contact key. Public key
  available on `keyserver.ubuntu.com` — see *Verifying releases* below for
  the fingerprint.

### What to include

- Affected version(s) — at minimum, the Maven coordinate
  (e.g. `io.github.kuiralabs:midnight-sdk:{{ kuira_version }}`).
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof-of-concept.
- Your assessment of impact and exploitability.
- Whether you want public credit, and how you'd like to be named.

### Response timeline

| Stage | Target |
|---|---|
| Acknowledgement of report | within **72 hours** |
| Initial triage + severity assessment | within **1 week** |
| Fix or mitigation plan | within **30 days** for high/critical |
| Coordinated disclosure | within **90 days** of initial report, or sooner if a fix has shipped |

If 90 days pass without a fix or a mutually agreed extension, you're free
to disclose publicly. We'd rather you do that than sit on an unfixed issue.

## Scope

### In scope

Vulnerabilities in code shipped under any of the published Maven artifacts:

```
io.github.kuiralabs:midnight-sdk
io.github.kuiralabs:dapp-ui
io.github.kuiralabs:wallet-seed
io.github.kuiralabs:wallet-runtime
io.github.kuiralabs:identity
io.github.kuiralabs:auth
io.github.kuiralabs:crypto
io.github.kuiralabs:network
io.github.kuiralabs:compact-engine
io.github.kuiralabs:indexer
io.github.kuiralabs:connector
io.github.kuiralabs:ledger
io.github.kuiralabs:designsystem
io.github.kuiralabs:testing
```

Particularly interested in issues affecting:

- **Key derivation and storage** — BIP-39 / BIP-32 / Schnorr / Bech32m
  implementations, Android Keystore integration, EncryptedSharedPreferences
  usage, seed wiping after use.
- **Passkey / Sigil identity** — PRF derivation, DID generation,
  authorization payload signing, Block Store backup encryption.
- **Transaction signing and proving** — anything that could produce an
  unintended on-chain effect.
- **Network surface** — indexer / node client (TLS pinning, replay,
  response validation).
- **Hilt graph misconfigurations** — anything that could silently route
  authority through the wrong domain or wrong key.

### Out of scope

Please report these to the appropriate upstream project, not to us:

- The Midnight protocol itself, the ledger, the node, the indexer, the
  Compact compiler — report to <https://github.com/midnightntwrk>.
- Android OS / Keystore / Credentials Manager vulnerabilities — report to
  Google's Android Security team.
- Issues only reproducible on rooted devices, emulators with debugging
  bridges, or with the user having installed malicious apps — see *Known
  limitations* below.
- The Kuira wallet app (not yet published) and the public example dApps
  (BBoard, the Kuira Starter) — these are reference implementations
  demonstrating SDK usage, not production products.

---

## Threat model

### What Kuira protects against

- **Cold device theft:** Seed material at rest is encrypted via Android
  Keystore (hardware-backed where available, falling back to TEE). A thief
  with the device but not the user's biometric / PIN cannot extract seeds.
- **Local file inspection:** Both the seed vault and the active-match /
  application-state store use `EncryptedSharedPreferences` with a
  Keystore-bound master key. Files in `/data/data/<pkg>/` are unreadable
  outside a Keystore-authenticated process.
- **Cloud backup interception:** The Block Store backup blob is
  **PRF-encrypted client-side** before Google Block Store touches it. A
  Google account compromise alone doesn't yield wallet access — the
  attacker also needs to forge a passkey assertion on a device the user
  controls.
- **Replay across dApps:** Each consumer dApp supplies its own
  `PasskeyConfig` (rpId + rpName); the SDK does not ship a maintainer
  default. Two dApps using the same SDK get cryptographically distinct
  passkeys and cannot impersonate each other.
- **Accidental seed exposure in logs:** Seed and PRF-derived material is
  never logged. Debug log lines that touch sensitive material are gated
  behind `BuildConfig.DEBUG` so R8 strips them from release builds.
- **Total device + account loss (opt-in sovereign exit):** A user who has
  exported their 24-word BIP-39 recovery phrase can restore the exact
  wallet on any device with no passkey, Google account, or cloud backup in
  the loop. The phrase is derived on demand from the same entropy that
  backs the seed — never stored or uploaded — and the reveal screen runs
  under `FLAG_SECURE` (no screenshots / recents thumbnail) with a clipboard
  that auto-clears.

### What Kuira does NOT protect against

We're explicit about this because hiding it isn't honest:

- **Compromised device** (rooted, malicious app with elevated privileges,
  unlocked while the attacker has physical access): once Keystore-bound
  keys are accessible to malicious code in the same process, the seed
  vault is recoverable. No app-level mitigation defeats a compromised
  trusted execution environment.
- **Malicious dApp in the same process:** dApps that integrate the SDK
  share the same Android process. There is no inter-dApp sandboxing
  beyond Android's normal process isolation. Vet the dApps you integrate.
- **User-side passkey loss with no exported recovery phrase:** A sovereign
  exit now exists — the user can reveal their 24-word BIP-39 recovery
  phrase (Settings → recovery phrase, biometric-gated) and restore the
  exact wallet on any device with no passkey, account, or backup involved.
  But it is **opt-in and one-way**: until the user deliberately reveals and
  writes the phrase down, recovery still rides their Google Password
  Manager passkey + Block Store backup. A user who loses the passkey AND
  the backup AND never exported the phrase has unrecoverable funds. (Sigil
  V2, announced on the [home page](index.md#whats-coming-next-sigil-v2),
  adds PIN-based recovery via an opaque cloud bucket as a separate track.)
- **Session-cache theft inside the unlock window:** Once a sigil session is
  unlocked, the decrypted seed lives in `MidnightSdkProvider`'s cached SDK
  instance, and value-bearing calls within the active window do not
  re-prompt for biometric. Auto-lock now bounds that window — the session
  locks on an idle timeout, on backgrounding, and on a device screen-lock,
  plus a manual "lock now" — but a device borrowed *while still unlocked*
  remains a real risk until the lock fires.
- **BLS proving parameters supply chain:** The SDK fetches Midnight's
  protocol-level proving keys (BLS params + wallet / zswap / Dust
  circuits) from `midnight-s3-fileshare-dev-eu-west-1`, a Midnight-team
  S3 bucket labeled "dev." A compromise of that bucket would let an
  attacker substitute proving keys. Documented in
  [Integration guide](integration.md) § Known limitations.
  Per-contract proving keys are unaffected — each dApp hosts its own.
- **Network-level interception:** The SDK uses HTTPS for indexer / node
  RPC. We do not currently implement certificate pinning. A
  network-level adversary with a forged certificate (e.g. compromised CA)
  could observe or alter RPC traffic. Considered for post-`1.0`.
- **Side-channel attacks on Keystore / TEE:** Out of our threat model.
  We trust Android's threat model for the underlying hardware-backed key
  store. Issues at that layer should be reported to Android Security.
- **Alpha API stability:** `0.1.x-alpha*` releases may have breaking API
  or behavioral changes. The semver guarantees of a `1.0.0` line do not
  apply. Pin exact versions in production usage.

## Supported versions

We backport security fixes only to versions still in active development.
For an alpha SDK, that means: **the most recent published alpha line.**

| Version | Status |
|---|---|
| `0.1.x-alpha*` | ✅ Supported — security fixes land in the next alpha bump |
| Older alphas | ❌ Not backported. Upgrade. |

When `1.0.0` ships, this table will be revised to a proper LTS / minor
policy. Until then, **stay current** — there's no minor-version stability
to rely on during alpha.

## Verifying releases

Every Maven Central artifact is signed with the maintainer's PGP key. To
verify a downloaded artifact:

**Key fingerprint:** `189C70EE67261AF5866CF1D052D6F3437CF490FA`

```bash
# Fetch the public key
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 189C70EE67261AF5866CF1D052D6F3437CF490FA

# Download the artifact and its signature
ARTIFACT=midnight-sdk-{{ kuira_version }}.aar
curl -O https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/kuiralabs/midnight-sdk/{{ kuira_version }}/$ARTIFACT
curl -O https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/kuiralabs/midnight-sdk/{{ kuira_version }}/$ARTIFACT.asc

# Verify
gpg --verify $ARTIFACT.asc $ARTIFACT
```

A successful verification output names the key as
`Good signature from "nel349 <kuiralabs@gmail.com>"`. Any other outcome
means the artifact does **not** correspond to a release the maintainer
published — do not use it.

The fingerprint is also published in this file and in the project's
GitHub repository description, so an attacker would have to compromise
both this repository and the keyserver to substitute a key undetected.

## Disclosure policy

We follow **coordinated disclosure**:

- Report → maintainer acknowledges and triages.
- Maintainer prepares a fix and a draft advisory.
- A target disclosure date is set (within the 90-day window, or sooner if
  the fix is ready).
- On the disclosure date: a patched release ships, the advisory is
  published via GitHub Security Advisories, the [changelog](changelog.md) names the
  affected versions, and — if the reporter wishes — credit is given by
  name.

If the issue is being actively exploited in the wild, the timeline
compresses. Tell us if you have reason to believe that's the case.

## Out-of-scope but appreciated

Even if a report doesn't qualify as a security vulnerability (typos in
crypto code, missing input validation that isn't exploitable, hardening
suggestions), open a regular GitHub issue or PR — we still want to know.
