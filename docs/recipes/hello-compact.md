# Hello Compact — write your first contract

**Outcome:** you have a 6-line Compact contract that compiles, deploys
on a Midnight localnet, and exposes a single circuit that bumps a
shared counter by one — the universal "Hello World" of smart contracts.
You can read every line of the source and the compile output, you know
which `compactc` + language + runtime versions go together, and you
have a clear next stop for everything beyond "make the counter go up."

!!! tip "What this recipe is, and what it isn't"
    This is the **SDK's minimum-viable Compact intro** — enough to read
    the counter contract that ships with [`kuira-starter-android`](https://github.com/kuiralabs/kuira-starter-android),
    understand the toolchain pinning that makes it work, and compile +
    deploy it.

    For Compact and Midnight themselves — the language, witnesses, ZK proof
    construction, ledger types beyond `Counter`, the on-chain model — Kuira is
    not where you learn them. Start at the **[Midnight documentation](https://docs.midnight.network/)**,
    then its **[contract examples](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-docs/tree/main/docs/examples/contracts)**
    (calculator, election, battleship, private-guest-list, …) for focused
    tutorials on each Compact pattern. We assume that familiarity here.

    The Kuira SDK consumes compiled Compact artifacts; it does not
    teach Compact authoring beyond what's in this recipe.

## The counter contract

```compact title="contract/src/counter.compact"
pragma language_version {{ compact_language_version }};

import CompactStandardLibrary;

export ledger count: Counter;

export circuit increment(): [] {
    count.increment(1);
}
```

Six lines. What each one does:

- `pragma language_version {{ compact_language_version }};` — pins the Compact language
  grammar version. The Compact language is versioned independently
  from `compactc` (the compiler) and from `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime`
  (the JS runtime that compiled contracts call into). Mismatched
  versions produce a `language version X.Y.Z mismatch` error at
  compile time.
- `import CompactStandardLibrary;` — brings in the standard library
  types and helpers, including `Counter`.
- `export ledger count: Counter;` — declares a single on-chain ledger
  field, named `count`, of type `Counter`. The Standard Library's
  `Counter` wraps a `Uint<64>` with built-in `.increment()` and
  `.read()` helpers. `export ledger` makes the field readable by
  off-chain clients (the Kuira SDK reads it by name via
  `contract.ledger().getUint64("count")`, or as a typed field on the
  generated contract facade).
- `export circuit increment(): [] { count.increment(1); }` — a single
  circuit that takes no arguments and bumps the counter by 1.
  Circuits are the on-chain entrypoints; calling one produces a
  ZK proof + a transaction that updates ledger state.

No witnesses, no privacy controls, no access checks. Anyone with Dust
can increment. The point is the SDK-integration story, not contract
design — for non-trivial patterns, jump to the [Midnight examples](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-docs/tree/main/docs/examples/contracts).

## Toolchain pinning

Three versions move independently. Mismatched values surface as
compile errors with the *generated* language version, not the version
you typed:

| Layer | Pinned value | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| `compactc` binary | **{{ compactc_version }}** | installed under `~/.compact/versions/{{ compactc_version }}/<os-arch>/`, driven via the `compact` wrapper |
| Compact language pragma | **{{ compact_language_version }}** | `pragma language_version <v>;` in your `.compact` source |
| `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime` | **{{ compact_runtime_version }}** | `contract/package.json` deps |

!!! note "On-chain runtime ships with the node"
    The Compact **runtime** is also embedded in the Midnight node.
    `midnight-node:0.22.5` — the `mn localnet` default — ships on-chain
    Compact runtime **{{ compact_runtime_version }}**, the runtime this
    contract targets. Older nodes (`≤ 0.22.3`) run runtime `0.15.0` and
    **reject** a {{ compact_runtime_version }} contract with a
    runtime-version mismatch. Stick with the default node and you're
    aligned.

The toolchain self-introspects:

```bash
compact list                                                 # installed compilers + the default
compact compile +{{ compactc_version }} --language-version   # → {{ compact_language_version }}
compact compile +{{ compactc_version }} --runtime-version    # → {{ compact_runtime_version }}
```

The language and runtime flags hang off `compact compile` (the
subcommand that owns them) — there is no bare `compactc --runtime-version`.

When upgrading, run the three commands on the new toolchain first to
discover the matching triple before editing any pragma. The starter's
[`contract/README.md`](https://github.com/kuiralabs/kuira-starter-android/blob/main/contract/README.md)
documents the upgrade recipe step by step.

---

## Set up the contract project

The compile + runtime live in a small npm project alongside your app.
The fastest path is to copy the starter's
[`contract/`](https://github.com/kuiralabs/kuira-starter-android/tree/main/contract)
directory — it already pins the toolchain — and install it:

```bash
cd contract
npm install
```

This pulls in `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime` (**{{ compact_runtime_version }}**,
the JS runtime compiled contracts call into) and makes the
`compact` / `compactc` devtools available, so the compile step below
has everything it needs. The starter's `contract/package.json` also
wires up `npm run compile` / `npm run inspect` shortcuts for the
commands you'll run by hand here.

---

## Compile + verify

From your project root:

```bash
mkdir -p contract/src/managed
compact compile +{{ compactc_version }} contract/src/counter.compact contract/src/managed/counter
```

!!! warning "Pin the compiler version with `+{{ compactc_version }}`"
    `compact` auto-selects the right binary for your *platform*, but it runs the
    toolchain's **default** compiler — which may be older than your
    `pragma language_version`. Compiling **without** the `+` pin fails with
    `language version X.Y.Z mismatch`; `+{{ compactc_version }}` forces the
    compiler that matches the pragma. (The `engines.compactc` field in
    `package.json` is informational — it is *not* enforced, and `npm run compile`
    must carry the same `+` pin.) Run `compact list` to see installed versions
    and the default.

    The binary directory varies by OS/arch (`aarch64-darwin`, `x86_64-darwin`,
    `x86_64-linux`, …) — never hardcode a path to it. On Windows, run under WSL2.

Output: a `contract/src/managed/counter/` directory containing
`contract/index.js` (the runnable contract), `keys/increment.verifier`
+ `keys/increment.prover` (proving + verifying keys), and `zkir/` (the
intermediate representation). After syncing into your app's assets as
`runtime/<alias>-contract.js`, this is what the Kuira SDK consumes via
`MidnightContract.create(sdk.config) { contractJs = context.assets.open(...) }`.

Quick sanity check with the `mn` CLI:

```bash
mn contract inspect --managed contract/src/managed/counter
```

The compile also writes the machine-readable
`contract/src/managed/counter/compiler/contract-info.json`, which
records the exact triple the artifacts were built with plus the
circuit shapes. For the counter it looks like this (trimmed):

```json title="compiler/contract-info.json"
{
  "compiler-version": "{{ compactc_version }}",
  "language-version": "{{ compact_language_version }}",
  "runtime-version": "{{ compact_runtime_version }}",
  "circuits": [
    { "name": "increment", "pure": false, "proof": true }
  ],
  "witnesses": [],
  "ledger": [
    { "name": "count", "exported": true, "storage": "Counter" }
  ]
}
```

The exact field set evolves with the compiler, so treat the block
above as **illustrative, not a byte-for-byte match** — read your own
file rather than diffing against this. What matters: the three
`*-version` values are the triple your artifacts were built with. If
they don't line up with the `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime` and
`pragma language_version` your project pins, re-align using the
toolchain table above.

For a full localnet verify loop (deploy → call → read state), follow
the starter's
[`contract/README.md` § Verify against a localnet](https://github.com/kuiralabs/kuira-starter-android/blob/main/contract/README.md).

## Wire it into an Android app

Once the contract is compiled, the Kuira SDK consumes it as Android
assets. See **[Deploy and call a Compact contract](deploy-and-call-a-compact-contract.md)**
for the integration walkthrough — the `io.github.kuiralabs.contract`
Gradle plugin (or a hand-rolled `syncContractAssets` Copy task), then
`MidnightContract.create(sdk.config) { … }` and `.deploy()` / `.call()`.

The Kuira SDK is happy to consume any Compact contract that `compactc`
produces — once you've moved beyond the counter, the Android-side
integration story doesn't change. Compile, drop the artifacts under
`contract/src/managed/<name>/`, point `MidnightContract.create` at
them, deploy, call.
